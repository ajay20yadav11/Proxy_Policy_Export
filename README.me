Proxy Policy Export (Proxy_Policy_Export.py) is a Python script designed to assist network security engineers in exporting policies and URL categories from a Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) device to an Excel spreadsheet. This tool provides a workaround for situations where the WSA device lacks a native feature to export this information to Excel.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following:

1. A Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) device accessible via a network connection.
2. Administrative credentials to access the WSA device.
3. Python 3.x installed on your local machine.

## Usage

Follow these steps to export policies and URL categories from the WSA device:

1. **Login to WSA Device:** Use your admin credentials to log in to the Cisco WSA device.

2. **Export Configuration File:** Navigate to the Configuration File section on the WSA device's web interface. Export the configuration file to a local directory. By default, the format of the exported file is XML. Save this file in the same directory where the Python script (Proxy_Policy_Export.py) is located.

3. **Run the Script:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script and the exported XML file, and execute the Python script using the following command:
